abberwocky

Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
id gyre and gimble in the wabe;
ll mimsy were the borogoves,
nd the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
he jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
eware the Jubjub bird, and shun
he frumious Bandersnatch!"

e took his vorpal sword in hand:
ong time the manxome foe he sought
o rested he by the Tumtum tree,
nd stood awhile in thought.

nd as in uffish thought he stood,
he Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
ame whiffling through the tulgey wood,
nd burbled as it came!

ne, two! One, two! and through and through
he vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
e left it dead, and with its head
e went galumphing back.

And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
ome to my arms, my beamish boy!
 frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
e chortled in his joy.

Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
id gyre and gimble in the wabe;
ll mimsy were the borogoves,
nd the mome raths outgrabe.
